Snake Game

This Java project features a Snake Game.
The game follows various features with a score, colors, and design.
The objective of the game is to move the snake towards the apple. If the snake touches the apple, 10 points are earned. If the snake moves to the far left, the snake will come from the right side. If the snake moves to the far right, the snake will come from the left side. Similarly, going up and down the snake follows this motion.

Each time the Graphical User Interface (GUI) is executed the apple is placed in a random spot using the Random class in Java. This project uses topics from core Java such as Array Lists, constructors, variables, switch/case/break statements, loops, if/else conditions, Graphics 2D class, Java Swing components, and more.


This game was completely coded in Java.
